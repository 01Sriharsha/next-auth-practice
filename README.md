# NextAuth.js Auth Toolkit Sandbox

This repository is created for practicing authentication and authorization using the NextAuth.js library in Next.js 14. It also serves as a toolkit for adding authentication to future Next.js projects, including reusable components.

## Overview

In this project, we'll be focusing on implementing authentication and authorization features using NextAuth.js, a flexible authentication library for Next.js applications. Additionally, we'll develop reusable components that can be easily integrated into other Next.js projects for authentication purposes.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd next-auth-practice
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure NextAuth.js:**
